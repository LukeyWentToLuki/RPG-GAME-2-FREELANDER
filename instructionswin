So playing freelander takes some installation and stuf, so lets get started!
THESE ARE INSTRUCTIONS FOR WINDOWS

If you havent played RPG GAME 1, you wouldnt know that there are some instructions there. But if you havent here are some instructions.

reqirements:
1. windows
2. admin

First, shutdown your pc.
Turn it on.
Keep pressin F1 every second (you can see where this is going)
then welcome to the BIOS (basic input/output system)
now scroll to your um I forgo. CPU settings I think, And enable Intel Virtulization, or it might just be called Virtulization. (Dont have that option, follow my instrctions,
First, get a screwdriver, open up your pc, Unscrew the GPU, and then take off the CPU carefully, then clean the thermal paste, then buy a intel processor, 
then screw the new one on the cpu slot, with thermal paste like a normal human. And done!)

after doing that
run your command prompt as admin and type the following:

wsl --install

after that get ubuntu from microsoft store.

your going to be using wsl2 but if you want wsl1 do dism.exe /online /enable-feature /featurename:Microsoft-Windows-Subsystem-Linux /all /norestart

then after everything installed, go to ubuntu, type:
cd /$HOME/
then do nano <filename>.sh
then copy freelander code.
then CTRL-X + y + ENTER
then do
chmod +x ./<filename>.sh
then do ./<filename>.sh
and bom you have gam.
